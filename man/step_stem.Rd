\title{Stemming of list-column variables}
\usage{
step_stem(recipe, ..., role = NA, trained = FALSE, columns = NULL,
  options = list(), stemmer = "SnowballC", skip = FALSE,
  id = rand_id("stem"))

\method{tidy}{step_stem}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{recipe}{A recipe object. The step will be added to the
sequence of operations for this recipe.}

\item{...}{One or more selector functions to choose variables.
For `step_stem`, this indicates the variables to be encoded
into a list column. See [recipes::selections()] for more
details. For the `tidy` method, these are not currently used.}

\item{role}{Not used by this step since no new variables are
created.}

\item{trained}{A logical to indicate if the recipe has been
baked.}

\item{columns}{A list of tibble results that define the
encoding. This is `NULL` until the step is trained by
[recipes::prep.recipe()].}

\item{options}{A list of options passed to the stemmer}

\item{stemmer}{a character to select stemming method. Defaults
to "SnowballC".}

\item{skip}{A logical. Should the step be skipped when the
recipe is baked by [recipes::bake.recipe()]? While all
operations are baked when [recipes::prep.recipe()] is run, some
operations may not be able to be conducted on new data (e.g.
processing the outcome variable(s)). Care should be taken when
using `skip = TRUE` as it may affect the computations for
subsequent operations.}

\item{id}{A character string that is unique to this step to identify it.}

\item{x}{A `step_stem` object.}
}
\value{
An updated version of `recipe` with the new step added
 to the sequence of existing steps (if any).
}
\description{
`step_stem` creates a *specification* of a recipe step that
 will convert a list of tokens into a list of stemmed tokens.
}
\details{
Words tend to have different forms depending on context, such as
organize, organizes, and organizing. In many situations it is beneficial
to have these words condensed into one to allow for a smaller pool of 
words. Stemming is the act of choping off the end of words using a set
 of heristics.

Note that the steming will only be done at the end of the string and 
will therefore not work reliably on ngrams or sentences.
